					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>There were actually quite a lot of challenges in this assignment:
						understanding what elements were needed (a label, text box, and a button),
						then understanding how to process the user input from the text box.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For the longest time, I thought that the input was supposed to be entered inside the button (I know, sounds wacky).
						Good thing I eventually realized that I needed a text box for the input. After, I wasn't sure about how to retrieve the user input 
						from text box. A little chat gpt research confirmed what I needed to do for me.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was probably the most confusing and difficult assignment, but it's all worth it. Now I know how to truly handle a button.</p>
