					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In terms of general challenges, it was playing around with the code so it did what I expected it to. I will elaborate more in the "Problems" section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The very first issue was the 'age' property in the javascript file. If I directly assigned age with the function feature and didn't add anymore code,
						the document.writeln would not output age at all, and the best I could do was to have age output as null. Therefore, I took things into my own hands 
						(or should I say Chat GPT's hands), and from there added a paragraph of code and changed the document.ln() just a little and eventually found a working solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another issue was trying to place the image on the complete right side of the screen while still have the title centered. This is an issue that 
						carried over from the previous lab. Initially, I did my own research online manually, but the "solutions" I found never actually worked for my case.
						Then again, I used Chat GPT, and even still, did not reach the desired output. Ultimately, I realized I could mix up some of the concepts I found from
						online, and mix them with chat gpt's ideas. Moreoever, I realized that adding the 'float: left' feature to the minor-section would easily solve the 
						last of my issues for this particular problem. After doing that, lo and behold, my website now has proper positioning and works like I want it to.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I'm glad I was so much more thorough with this lab than pretty much any other previous lab. I made sure all corners were covered
						(in a sense quite literally), and put in a lot of extra effort so that there were no "half-done" tasks.
