				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>For the issues I had, I wouldn't consider them challenges. I would consider them problems.
					Overall, I don't think I had any true challenges with this assignment.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The only problem I had was figuring out what the proper syntax was in outputting my Results
					to the output div. I tried using the jquery version, but it didn't print out. I looked at the console but 
					there were no noticeable issues. I then tried to print out the value of my result, and it was as I expected it
					to be. I then noticed that compared to how the Canvas Instructions did it, I forgot to put the hashtag 
					in front of 'output', so it was finding an output tag, not an output id.
				</p>
				 <p>Once I figured that out, I realized that the output was all mushed up together with no line breakage, so it was messy.
					I was iniitally doing "\n" which stands for newline feed, but I guess it might not have worked as I wanted it to.
					I ended up just following the professor's code and using a break (br) instead.
