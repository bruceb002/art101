			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Prolem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It was pretty simple to come up with the high level tasks and even sub-tasks. The only challenge
						was formatting to outlines.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A simple problem we did come across was that upon copy and pasting the outlines
						from VS Code, it would copy a colored background that we couldn't get rid of. 
						I decided to copy the text in an unexpected surprising medium (a textbox from an online 
						file difference checker) and paste it back onto the Google Doc, which got rid of the colors. 
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this was one of the more straight-forward simple assignments. It went pretty smooth and, well, straightforward.</p>

						<h3>Everyday Task Pseudocode</h3>
						<pre>
<strong>Ironing</strong>
- Setting up each object component
	- Board
		- Unfold ironing board
		- Make sure its on flat surface + stable
	- Iron
		- Optional: adding water (if Iron has feature and clothes need steam)
		- Plug in/Turn on
		- Alter settings to appropriate choices
		- Allow for iron to heat up
	- Clothes
		- Make sure first clothing article is laid flat out on board neatly
- Ironing Process
	- Repeat for every clothing item:
	- 	Pick up iron and lay flat on top of clothing item (where necessary/clothes are wrinkled)
	- 	Repeat until item is ironed out wherever necessary
			- Continuously move iron w/ consistent pressure across clothing to flatten out
			- Don’t let iron sit very long
			- Press steam button if necessary 
	- Hang up each clothing item to prevent future wrinkles
- Take-down process
	- Unplug iron
	- Allow iron to cool down
	- Once cooled put iron away
	- Fold up Ironing board
						</pre>

						<h3>Simplified Game Pseudcode</h3>
						<pre>
							<code>
//Print board before each turn
//Accept user input
//Validate User input
	//Check that column still has empty slots
	//Place piece on lowest empty row of column
//Evaluate possible moves
	//Check which columns still are empty
	//Prioritize moves where user might come close to winning
//Choose computer move
//Test for win or draw situation
	//Win: four in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
	//draw : board filled up with no four in a row for either player
							</code>
						</pre>

						<h3>Expanded Game Pseudocode</h3>
						<pre>
							<code>
//Print board before each turn
	// Loop through each row
		// Loop through each space
			// Print R (red), Y (yellow), or Space
			// Print a | between each cell
				// Print a newline at the end
				// Print a horizontal line between
//Accept user input
	// allow user to pick a column to place their piece in
		// read over user input 
//Validate User input
	//Check that column user entered still has empty slots
		//Loop from bottom up until empty slot is found
			//Place piece on lowest empty row of column
		//if no empty slot, this is invalid
			//have user enter new choice
	//Loop until User inputs valid input
//Evaluate possible moves
	//loop every column left to right and check which columns still have empty slots
		//mark every lowest possible slot as a valid placement
//Choose computer move
	//check for valid placement slots that are adjacent (vertically, horizontally, diagonally) to
	computers own pieces
	// place computer piece in random valid slot that is adjacent 
		// if there are no pieces already placed for computer OR 
		if there are no valid slots adjacent to computer’s pieces
			// choose any random valid placement slot
	//end computer turn
//Test for win or draw situation
	// after each turn, loop through board and check for win/draw conditions
		//Win: four in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
		//draw : board filled up with no four in a row for either player
