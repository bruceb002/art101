			<h1>Hello World</h1>
            <p>Hi! We are Bruce Bai and Kelsey Melott. We are in the same section
                and thought that it would be fun and interactive to work with one another.
                We find that HTML and CSS is already super interesting to play around with. 
                Bruce is interested in singing, drawing, and programming. 
                Kelsey is interested in character design, writing, and not programming XD. 
                We look forward to what we will learn in this class. </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab were learning to understand HTML and css.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was difficult to understand what the instructions entailed because this html file
						had different content than what the instructions specified on Canvas.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Initially it was simple, then we had to go back to do this assignment again because of the problem
						stated above.</p>
