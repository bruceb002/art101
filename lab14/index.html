					<p>Looking back at this lab, I realized that the program would behave in an undefined manner if the user
						were to input non-numerical values instead of numbers for the maxNum or factors. Therefore, I decided to add 
						more error handling for that. I found out a way using regular expressions, and had some bumps along the way.</p>

					<p>I first noticed that using the regular expression wasn't capturing non-numerical values at first. After printing
						out the var.match(regex) value to the console, I realized that the value would be null if there was no match.
						I thought that the value was going to be true if it didn't match but evidently, I thought wrong (aka I thought the opposite).</p>
					
					<p>After that, it finally began capturing non-numerical values. However, the regex also captured empty values and
						displayed the non-numerical error message along with the empty value message when it was just an empty field. That I did not want.
						Therefore, I added on last condition while searching for non-numerical values - it cannot be empty. After that, my program worked
						completely as expected.</p>
