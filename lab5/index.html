					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The biggest challenge was to place the image on the side of the title.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>First, the image wouldn't even place onto the side of the title. 
						It would not appear at all, or if it did, it would initially mess up the placement
						of every other box as well. Even then, I couldn't find a way to place it specifically on the right side
						of the title. I settled for the left side of the title since it already worked that way.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For the most part this assignment went smoothly. Typing into the console and Javascript file was simple.
						Again, the only trouble was positioning the image.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
						<h3>Script Output</h3>
						<!-- Link to javascript file - DEFER waits until all elements are rendered -->
						<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/lab.js"></script>
